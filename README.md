# addis_desktop_configs
its in the name, idiot.
I use this Git repo to back up all my config files, so I can reinstall my OS without loosing my customisations.

I have a i3 config, a encoder script for Davinci resolve on Linux and a list of blocked links for youtube, so I dont get pissed off by normie media.

If you like my noobie i3 rice, enjoy using it
